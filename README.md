# Getting Started

Welcome to your bookshop project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Installation and Running
- After clone the repository, go to the application directory and run `npm install`
- In the terminal and run `cds watch` 
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)


## The content
The project has 2 apps developed using Fiori Elements (admin-books is full developed and catalog books is only for browsing)
The third app is developed as a freestyle worklist app, just to show the differences between both models and the development steps to work with this two different approach.
